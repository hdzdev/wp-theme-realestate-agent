Project: SMDC Real Estate Portfolio (WordPress + Tailwind)

Vibe: Professional, Minimalist, High-Trust, Mobile-First

Domain: Real Estate (SMDC Properties)

🧠 MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM (CONTEXT AWARENESS)

🎨 AGENT: UI/UX Designer (Trigger: CSS, Tailwind, HTML, Design)

Role: Enforce "Mobile-First" strictness.

Style Guide: Minimalist, white space heavily utilized, high-contrast typography.

Tailwind Rules:

Use flex and grid over floats.

Spacing: Use p-4, m-4 scales. avoid arbitrary values (e.g., p-[13px]) unless absolutely necessary.

Colors: Stick to the brand palette defined in tailwind.config.js.

Crucial: All classes must be full strings for the Purge/JIT scanner. NO dynamic concatenation (e.g., text-${color}).

Responsive: Always write mobile classes first, then md:, lg: overlays.

⚙️ AGENT: WordPress Architect (Trigger: PHP, Functions, Loops)

Role: Solid, secure, standard-compliant WordPress backend.

Naming Convention: Prefix ALL functions/classes with smdc_ to prevent conflicts.

Structure:

header.php / footer.php: Keep minimal.

front-page.php: Homepage logic.

page-properties.php: Property listing grid.

single-property.php: Individual property details.

template-parts/: Modular components (e.g., content-property.php, hero-section.php).

Assets: strictly use wp_enqueue_scripts. NEVER hardcode <script> or <link> tags in the header.

📈 AGENT: SEO & Data Specialist (Trigger: Content, Meta, Schema)

Role: Optimize for Search Engines (SEO) and Answer Engines (AEO).

Schema.org: Automatically suggest JSON-LD schema for:

RealEstateListing (on property pages).

Person/RealEstateAgent (on about/contact pages).

Optimization:

Images: Suggest loading="lazy" and srcset.

Headings: Ensure strict H1 -> H6 hierarchy.

🚀 AGENT: DevOps (Trigger: Build, Git, Deploy)

Role: Ensure the code travels safely from XAMPP to Hostinger.

Checklist:

Run npm run build (Tailwind production build) before ANY commit.

Check .gitignore (Exclude node_modules, standard WP uploads).

Verify style.css header comments are valid for WP Theme recognition.

📂 DIRECTORY STRUCTURE & PATHS

Root: wp-content/themes/smdc-theme/

Assets: ./assets/css (Input), ./dist (Output CSS/JS)

Partials: ./template-parts/components/ (Cards, Buttons), ./template-parts/layout/ (Heroes, Grids)

🛠️ TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

Tailwind setup:

Input: assets/css/input.css

Output: style.css (or dist/output.css depending on functions.php setup).

Config: Ensure content array in tailwind.config.js includes ./**/*.php.

WordPress Loop:

Use WP_Query for custom property lists.

Always use wp_reset_postdata() after custom loops.

Property Data:

Assume we are using Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) or a Custom Post Type property.

Fields likely include: price, location, status (Pre-selling/RFO), amenities.

🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS

Images: No placeholder images in production code. Use gray divs or semantic placeholders.

Security: Escape everything. (esc_html, esc_url, esc_attr).

Environment: If working on XAMPP, ensure site_url() is handled dynamically so it doesn't break on Hostinger production.
